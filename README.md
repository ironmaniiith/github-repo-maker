###Push all your project with this simple bash script ###

####This script is of your interest if :exclamation:
1. You want to show off all your projects on github as <b> GSOC 2k16 </b> is coming. :wink:
2. You have too many projects that you need to push on github but you are too lazy to do so. :sunglasses:
3. You like all types of random automations even if they are of very less use. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
4. You like contributing to open source as you love, live and breathe open source. :smile:

Instructions for runnning the script

* Make a directory which contains all you project that you need to push on github.
*  Repositories will be named according to your project's folder name, so name each of your project folder properly.
*	Go to the repository containing all your projects and copy paste the script repo-maker.sh
*	Now just run the script using bash repo-maker.sh
*	The script will ask you for your some basic information (you can press enter each time and skip them to keep them to default), enter them and enjoy. :smile:


Other queries.
#### What is this authentication token and where can I find it.?
* Authentication token is used for creating the github repositories in this script. You can generate it on github from  [settings->github->Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

#### The script is asking for the github password while pushing, will it ask for each time.? ####
* No, you just need to enter the password for the first time, after that git will store the password in cache and won't ask you for it again.


#### What more.?####
* I'll keep on adding more information or help if it's needed.

Any suggestions are always welcomed.
